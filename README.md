# Technohacks-Project
It involves collection of data and visualization of data

Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Visualization on a large Weather dataset.
Using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, we explore statistical properties, visualize correlations, detect trends, and understand the relationship between weather conditions and temperature.

Generate descriptive statistics

Detect missing values

Convert date fields for time series analysis

Visualize:

Correlation heatmap between numerical features

Line plot showing temperature trends over time

Box plots for temperature distribution across different weather conditions


Technologies Used
Python 3

Pandas

Seaborn

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook



Outputs
